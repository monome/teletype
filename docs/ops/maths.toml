Euclidean rhythm helper, as described by Godfried Toussaint in his 2005 paper ["The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms"][euclidean_rhythm_paper][^euclidean_rhythm_citation]. From the abstract:

 - `f` is fill (`1-32`) and should be less then or equal to length
 - `l` is length (`1-32`)
 - `i` is the step index, and will work with negative as well as positive numbers

If you wish to add rotation as well, use the following form:

```
ER f l SUB i r
```

where `r` is the number of step of _forward_ rotation you want.
