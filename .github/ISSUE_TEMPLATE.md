_This is a new issue template, it's not a required format, but gives a basis for consistent issue reporting. Issues are used for bug reports and new features. Two templates are embedded below, one for bugs, one for new features. The bug template guides a user through the process of filing a bug report. The feature template is a suggested format, but should be considered more flexible._
